# Mailopolis — Adversarial City Sustainability Game

## Premise
You are a sustainability advisor competing directly against bad actors to influence a city's sustainability trajectory. You analyze blockchain-recorded transactions, craft policy recommendations, and personally lobby the Mayor, while developer groups and other adversaries try to corrupt the city with unsustainable practices for profit.

## Core Concept
The game is an adversarial strategy simulation where:
- **You** directly create and send policy recommendations to influence the Mayor
- **The Mayor** makes decisions based on competing advice from you vs. bad actors
- **Departments** execute policies set by the Mayor, affecting the city's sustainability
- **Bad Actors** (developers, corporations) pay currency to influence the Mayor toward unsustainable policies
- **Blockchain** records all transactions, providing transparent state information for your strategic decisions

Your goal is to outmaneuver adversaries through superior strategy, timing, and persuasion to guide the city toward maximum sustainability.

## Primary Objective
**City Sustainability Index** (0–100): Average sustainability score across all city departments. You win by maximizing this index while bad actors try to minimize it through corrupted mayoral policies.

## Game Architecture

### The Competition Loop
1. **You** analyze blockchain transaction data to understand current city state
2. **You craft policy recommendations** and send advice to Mayor via AgentMail
3. **Bad Actors** simultaneously lobby Mayor with competing (unsustainable) proposals + currency bribes
4. **Mayor weighs advice** and decides on city policies based on influence levels and persuasiveness
5. **Departments execute policies**, affecting their individual sustainability scores
6. **City Sustainability Index** updates as average of all department scores
7. **Blockchain records** all transactions, policy changes, and outcomes for your next strategic decisions

### Your Role: Direct Sustainability Strategist
You directly engage in the political battle for the city's future by:
- **Analyzing blockchain data** to understand true city state and identify corruption
- **Crafting compelling policy proposals** that compete with bad actor influence
- **Timing interventions** strategically to maximize impact
- **Building Mayor trust** through successful policy outcomes and accurate predictions
- **Countering bad actor strategies** with superior arguments and evidence

### Your Strategic Tools
- **Data Analysis**: Study blockchain patterns to expose corruption and predict outcomes
- **Policy Design**: Create specific, actionable recommendations for each city department
- **Persuasion Tactics**: Choose your messaging approach (economic, environmental, social justice angles)
- **Coalition Building**: Align with supportive departments and citizen groups
- **Counter-Intelligence**: Anticipate and respond to bad actor moves

## Game Flow

### Round Structure
1. **Intelligence Gathering**: You review blockchain data to assess current city state and bad actor activities
2. **Strategic Planning**: You analyze the situation and plan your policy recommendations  
3. **Policy Creation**: You craft specific sustainability proposals for the Mayor
4. **Influence Battle**: Your proposals compete against bad actor lobbying via AgentMail

## Example Game Round

### Scenario: Developer Corruption vs. Green Infrastructure
A powerful developer group is lobbying the Mayor to approve a sprawling suburban development that would significantly harm the city's sustainability index.

### Setup
- **Current City Sustainability Index**: 72/100
- **Developer Offer**: $2M to Mayor + campaign contributions for approval
- **Your Mission**: Convince Mayor that sustainable urban infill is more profitable long-term

### Round 1: Intelligence Gathering
1. **Blockchain Analysis**: You process recent transactions and discover:
   - Developer has paid $500K in "consulting fees" to Mayor's office this month
   - Transportation Department sustainability dropped 8 points due to increased sprawl
   - Housing Department scored +12 points from recent transit-oriented development
2. **AgentMail Monitoring**: You observe developer's persuasion strategy focusing on short-term job creation

### Round 2: Policy Competition  
**Developer's Pitch** (via AgentMail to Mayor):
- "Project creates 500 construction jobs immediately"
- "Generates $50M in property tax revenue over 10 years"  
- "Meets housing demand with affordable single-family homes"

**Your Counter-Proposal**:
- "Urban infill creates 750 permanent jobs (vs. 500 temporary)"
- "Transit-oriented development generates $80M revenue + reduces infrastructure costs"
- "Sustainable housing appreciates 15% faster, benefiting all residents"

### Round 3: Mayor's Decision
Mayor weighs the options:
- **Developer influence**: High monetary incentive + political pressure
- **Your credibility**: Strong based on previous successful recommendations  
- **Department feedback**: Housing supports infill, Transportation opposes sprawl

**Outcome**: Mayor chooses sustainable infill development

### Round 4: Implementation & Results
- **Housing Department**: +8 sustainability points (density + green building)
- **Transportation**: +5 points (reduced car dependency)
- **Energy**: +3 points (efficient building standards)
- **Economic Development**: +6 points (innovation district creation)
- **Net Result**: City Sustainability Index increases from 72 to 76

### Your Strategic Learning
- **Successful Strategy**: Economic arguments more effective than environmental ones with this Mayor
- **Timing Insight**: Counter-proposals work best within 24 hours of developer pitches  
- **Coalition Building**: Aligning with department interests amplifies influence
- **Strategy Adjustment**: Focus more on economic benefits in future policy recommendations

## Adversarial Strategies

### Bad Actor Tactics
- **Bribery**: Direct payments to Mayor and department heads
- **Misinformation**: False data about sustainability costs and benefits
- **Political Pressure**: Threats about job losses and economic impacts
- **Timing Attacks**: Last-minute proposals to prevent thorough analysis
- **Coalition Corruption**: Turning departments against each other

### Your Counter-Strategies
- **Data Superiority**: Use blockchain verification to expose false claims with hard evidence
- **Economic Reframing**: Show long-term financial benefits of sustainability to appeal to Mayor's interests
- **Alliance Building**: Coordinate with aligned departments and citizen groups for unified messaging
- **Rapid Response**: Quickly craft superior policy alternatives to bad actor proposals
- **Transparency Campaigns**: Publicly expose corruption attempts using blockchain evidence
