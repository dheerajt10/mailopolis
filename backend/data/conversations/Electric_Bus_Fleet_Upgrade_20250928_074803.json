I foresee numerous opportunities for optimizing energy flow and potentially even vehicle-to-grid applications, which would be a significant academic endeavor. I assume the Water Department has no 'unforeseen' hydrological impacts to raise, given it's purely an electrical engineering matter?\"",

My primary focus is always on maximizing corporate profits and attracting significant investment to Mailopolis, ensuring a truly business-friendly environment. We need to evaluate any proposal through that lens: what's the ROI for our corporate partners, and how can we streamline operations by eliminating unnecessary red tape?\nConfidence: 9\nConcerns: My main concern is that any \"upgrade\" doesn't become a regulatory burden or a drain on corporate bottom lines without a clear, substantial profit incentive.",
