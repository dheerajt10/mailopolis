Actually, the data shows that transitioning to electric buses is not only superior in terms of emissions but also offers a wealth of research opportunities for us to publish groundbreaking papers. I'm curious to see how you plan to address the community's skepticism about this, as their concerns are often rooted in ignorance rather than scientific fact.",

In adherence to our established bureaucracy, I must firmly oppose this proposal.",
