POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING:
{conversation_summary}
{lobbying_summary}
{coalition_summary}
{positions_summary}

As Mayor, you've observed the political maneuvering around this proposal. Consider:

1. WHO LOBBIED YOU: Which departments made the effort to influence you?
2. COALITION STRENGTH: Are there strong alliances for/against?
3. POLITICAL COSTS: What are the political implications of your decision?
4. DEPARTMENT EXPERTISE: Which departments have the most relevant expertise?
5. PUBLIC PERCEPTION: How will this decision affect your approval rating?

The agents who lobbied you directly are showing this issue is important to them. Those who didn't lobby either don't care strongly or are politically passive.

Provide your decision in the standard format:
Decision: [SUPPORT/OPPOSE/NEUTRAL]
Reasoning: [Your mayoral perspective considering the political dynamics in 2-3 sentences]
Confidence: [1-10]
Political_Impact: [How this decision affects your political standing and relationships]"""
